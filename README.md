# Your Game Race Styleguide

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Journerist/ygr-styleguide.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This repository contains style definitions using SASS (SCSS syntaxx) that are used to build Your Game Race.

This enables sites to:

- create applications that looks similar but that can be different in its structure
- clean implementation of css based components
- clear separation between styling and behavior
